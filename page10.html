        <h3>
        <p>  Everyone has hobbies.</p>
        <p> Hobbies are what people like to do in their free time. </p>
        <p>  Hobbies are a great thing, they can help with stress and make you happier overall.</p>
        <p> Some of *my* personal hobbies include: </p>
        <p>  playing guitar</p>
        <p>  soccer</p>
        <p>  video games</p>
        <p>  Hobbies are what make people not go crazy, it's always good to have one.</p>
        <p>  In our culture, hobbies are very important to everyone.</p>
<p> If you walked up to *anyone* right now and asked if they have any hobbies, unless they don't want to say them I am 90% sure they will say yes.</p>
<p> Of course, you might say "I dont have any". </p>
<p> Even something as simple as baking is a hobby! </p>
