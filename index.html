            <p>Everyone has a different culture, some people may think others are strange, but this is not true. They are just different.</p>
            <p>If you look to the middle of the screen, up above you will see buttons for each page.</p>
            <p>This website wasn't made by anyone but myself.</p>
            <p>Do not expect it to wow you, I just didn't want to write it all on a google doc.</p>
            <p>That would be boring.</p>
            <p>(please note that when you are on the homepage, the "notes" button is weird.</p>
            <p>If you push the bit of purple it is still functional, though.</p>
            <p>I could not find a way to fix this, if you go to a different page it works.</p>
