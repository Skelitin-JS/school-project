            <p>Each culture has different thoughts on what "fashion" is.</p>
            <p>Most cultures want to look nice and may have a different idea on what looks appealing.</p>
            <p>We, as Americans, and Iowans change our idea of "fashion" everytime something new comes along.</p>
            <p>Even within our cultures, everyone has different ideas of what clothes or styles look good.</p>
            <p>Normally, Iowans wear typical clothing.</p>
            <p>Shirt, shoes, pants, etc.</p>
            <p>Many people wear sweatshirts, and for some maybe a baseball cap.</p>
            <p>Sunglasses are very popular in our culture, the reason why is because when it gets sunny it gets SUNNY.</p>
            <p>Overall, when it comes to clothing it's really up to your personal preference.</p>
