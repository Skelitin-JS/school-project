(Extra Info)
On the home page, the "notes" button has an error. For some reason it is not a full button.
The code was being weird, it shouldn't appear like this but apparently it does. The little piece of 
purple by the text is still a functional button.
If you are on this page, you will see there is no buttons to go back to the actual cultural elements.
Simply go back to the page by clicking the <- back arrow at the top left of your browser, right by the url.

Make everything look nice

1st cultural element:
Clothing:
Each culture has different thoughts on what "fashion" is. 
They all want to look nice, and may not think what we think is nice, looks appealing.
We, as Americans, and Iowans change our idea of "fashion" everytime something new comes along.
Even within our culture, everyone has their own idea of "fashion".
Normally, Iowans and wear typical clothing.
Shirt, shoes, pants etc.
Many people wear sweatshirts, and some maybe a baseball cap.
Sunglasses are very popular in our culture, with brands like "pitviper" and others.
With clothing, it's really up to preference with the style.

2nd cultural element:
Food:
Our culture has many varities of food, from many different places. 
Pizza, french fries, and tacos are very popular foods in America/Iowa but they didn't even originate in this country.
Not many foods within our culture are actually from where we live, nor are the ingredients.
Corn, and beans are very widely grown in Iowa, so many foods are made from them.
Other recipes enter our country when people from different countries migrate, and show their recipes.
Our culture doesn't have many sacred recipes overall, but there are many recipes passed
 down by members of your family through the generations.

3rd Cultural Element:
 Language:
 There are over 7000 languages spoken today, English being the most prominantly used. Many countires have a national language.
 Our culture has many different people of different races, and speaking different languages.
 Some people may speak more than 1 language, or maybe more than 2. There is no limit.
 It's important to learn your language adequately, and know all of the usages of words.
 Knowing what your language is built upon, and where it orignated from will help you better understand your culture
 and your heritage.
