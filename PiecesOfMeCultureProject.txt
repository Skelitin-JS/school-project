1st cultural element:
Clothing
Each culture has different thoughts on what "fashion" is. 
They all want to look nice, and may not think what we think is nice, looks appealing.
We, as Americans, and Iowans change our idea of "fashion" everytime something new comes along.
Even within our culture, everyone has their own idea of "fashion".
Normally, Iowans and wear typical clothing.
Shirt, shoes, pants etc.
Many people wear sweatshirts, and some maybe a baseball cap.
Sunglasses are very popular in our culture, with brands like "pitviper" and others.
With clothing, it's really up to preference with the style.
